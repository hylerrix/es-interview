## Thinking in React – React (2023-12-14)

There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state. The two are very different:

- [](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)[Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) are like arguments you pass to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance. For example, a Form can pass a color prop to a Button.
- [](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)[State](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) is like a component’s memory. It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. For example, a Button might keep track of isHovered state.

Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:

- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t stated.
- Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!

(If you’re familiar with the concept of [state](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory), don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.)

That’s because UI and data models often have the same information architecture—that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

## Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe – React (2023-12-14)

To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.

JavaScript supports [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick) has access to variables and functions defined in a outer function (e.g. Board). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares method because they are both defined inside of the Board function.

```
<Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick(0)} />
```

Here is why this doesn’t work. The handleClick(0) call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because handleClick(0) alters the state of the board component by calling setSquares, your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs handleClick(0) again, leading to an infinite loop:

> Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.

an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.

## Describing the UI – React (2023-12-14)

A dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render. A large bundle size regresses user experience for React apps. Understanding the module dependency tree is helpful to debug such issues.

Components near the top of the tree, near the root component, are considered top-level components. Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance.

Modelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree.

Some JavaScript functions are pure. A pure function:

- Minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.    
- Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows.

## Importing and Exporting Components – React  (2023-12-16)


People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like export default () => {}, are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

## Your First Component – React  (2023-12-17)

React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a <TableOfContents /> component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like `<article>`, `<h1>`, etc.

## Writing Markup with JSX – React  (2023-12-18)

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects.

JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can’t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array.

But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.

For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files! Content was marked up inside HTML while the page’s logic lived separately in JavaScript

## Keeping Components Pure – React  (2023-12-18)

React’s rendering process must always be pure. Components should only return their JSX, and not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!

## Conditional Rendering – React  (2023-12-18)

Don’t put numbers on the left side of &&.

To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.

In React, markup is a part of your code, so you can use tools like variables and functions to tidy up complex expressions.

## Rendering Lists – React  (2023-12-18)

Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

## Adding Interactivity – React  (2023-12-19)

In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.

## Responding to Events – React  (2023-12-19)

use `<button onClick={handleClick}>` instead of `<div onClick={handleClick}>`. Using a real browser `<button>` enables built-in browser behaviors like keyboard navigation.

## Render and Commit – React  (2023-12-19)

React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.

## State as a Snapshot – React  (2023-12-19)

React keeps the state values “fixed” within one render’s event handlers.

A state variable’s value never changes within a render, even if its event handler’s code is asynchronous.

## State: A Component's Memory – React  (2023-12-19)

Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is [rendering](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render)

## Updating Arrays in State – React  (2023-12-20)


In general, you should only mutate objects that you have just created. If you were inserting a new artwork, you could mutate it, but if you’re dealing with something that’s already in state, you need to make a copy.

Why is mutating state not recommended in React?

There are a few reasons:
- Debugging: If you use console.log and don’t mutate state, your past logs won’t get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders.
- Optimizations: Common React [optimization strategies](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If prevObj === obj, you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it.
- New Features: The new React features we’re building rely on state being [treated like a snapshot.](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) If you’re mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features.
- Requirement Changes: Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on.
- Simpler Implementation: Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many “reactive” solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state—no matter how large—without additional performance or correctness pitfalls.
In practice, you can often “get away” with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you!

The draft provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), that “records” what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the draft have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.

Mutation is only a problem when you change existing objects that are already in state. Mutating an object you’ve just created is okay because no other code references it yet. Changing it isn’t going to accidentally impact something that depends on it. This is called a “local mutation”. You can even do local mutation [while rendering.](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret) Very convenient and completely okay!

In other words, you should treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.

## Queueing a Series of State Updates – React (2023-12-20)

In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes.

Updater functions run during rendering, so updater functions must be [pure](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure) and only return the result. Don’t try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects.

React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.

## Queueing a Series of State Updates – React (2023-12-20)

It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1), you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like setNumber(n => n + 1). It is a way to tell React to “do something with the state value” instead of just replacing it.

React does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks—each click is handled separately.

React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.

## Reacting to Input with State – React (2023-12-20)

They don’t know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It’s called imperative because you have to “command” each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer how to update the UI.

## Sharing State Between Components – React (2023-12-22)

Uncontrolled components are easier to use within their parents because they require less configuration. But they’re less flexible when you want to coordinate them together. Controlled components are maximally flexible, but they require the parent components to fully configure them with props.

## Choosing the State Structure – React (2023-12-23)

If your state variable is an object, remember that [you can’t update only one field in it](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state) without explicitly copying the other fields.

Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need.

If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.

## Preserving and Resetting State – React (2023-12-23)

Specifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state.

always declare component functions at the top level, and don’t nest their definitions.

As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.

Remember that it’s the position in the UI tree—not in the JSX markup—that matters to React!

In this example, there are two different <Counter /> tags:

When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.

## Extracting State Logic into a Reducer – React (2023-12-23)

Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:
- Reducers must be pure. Similar to [state updater functions](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates), reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers [must be pure](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure)—same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update [objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [arrays](https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) without mutations.
- Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one reset_form action rather than five separate set_field actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging!

Reducers are not without downsides! Here’s a few ways you can compare them:
- Code size: Generally, with useState you have to write less code upfront. With useReducer, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, useReducer can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.
- Readability:useState is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, useReducer lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers.
- Debugging: When you have a bug with useState, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With useReducer, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which action). If each action is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with useState.
- Testing: A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.
- Personal preference: Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between useState and useReducer back and forth: they are equivalent!
We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don’t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even useState and useReducer in the same component.
We recommend wrapping each case block into the { and } curly braces so that variables declared inside of different cases don’t clash with each other. Also, a case should usually end with a return.

## Passing Data Deeply with Context – React (2023-12-23)

Context is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below!
Similarly, different React contexts don’t override each other.
Similarly, in React, the only way to override some context coming from above is to wrap children into a context provider with a different value.
Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings” and display themselves differently depending on where (or, in other words, in which context) they are being rendered.

## Escape Hatches – React (2023-12-23)

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you’ve included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect’s dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. The way you remove them depends on the case.

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values they read, like props or state, are different than during last render. Sometimes, you want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others.

All code inside Effects is reactive. It will run again if some reactive value it reads has changed due to a re-render.

React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. If you forget to specify roomId in the list of dependencies in the above example, the linter will find that bug automatically.

calculate as much as you can while rendering

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

There are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:
- You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering.
- You don’t need Effects to handle user events.

In development, React will immediately run and clean up your Effect one extra time. This is why you see "✅ Connecting..." printed twice. This ensures that you don’t forget to implement the cleanup function.

React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React—for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.

A ref is like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. For example, you can use refs to store [timeout IDs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout#return_value), [DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and other objects that don’t impact the component’s rendering output.

When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to [trigger new renders](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit), you can use a ref:

```
constref = useRef(0);
```

Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not! You can access the current value of that ref through the ref.current property.

## Referencing Values with Refs – React (2023-12-23)

imitations of React state don’t apply to refs. For example, state acts like a [snapshot for every render](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) and [doesn’t update synchronously.](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) But when you mutate the current value of a ref, it changes immediately:

```
ref.current = 5;
console.log(ref.current);// 5
```

This is because the ref itself is a regular JavaScript object, and so it behaves like one.

Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations:
- Storing [timeout IDs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/setTimeout)
- Storing and manipulating [DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element), which we cover on [the next page](https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)
- Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.
If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.


React provides a built-in version of useRef because it is common enough in practice. But you can think of it as a regular state variable without a setter. If you’re familiar with object-oriented programming, refs might remind you of instance fields—but instead of this.something you write somethingRef.current.

Since the interval ID is not used for rendering, you can keep it in a ref

like [state](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory), you could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. Unlike state, ref is a plain JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify.

You can access the current value of that ref through the ref.current property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)

## Manipulating the DOM with Refs – React (2023-12-23)


- Refs are a generic concept, but most often you’ll use them to hold DOM elements.
- You instruct React to put a DOM node into myRef.current by passing `<div ref={myRef}>`.
- Usually, you will use refs for non-destructive actions like focusing, scrolling, or measuring DOM elements.
- A component doesn’t expose its DOM nodes by default. You can opt into exposing a DOM node by using forwardRef and passing the second ref argument down to a specific node.
- Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React.
- If you do modify DOM nodes managed by React, modify parts that React has no reason to update.

Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React. Modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements that are managed by React can lead to inconsistent visual results or crashes like above.

However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t do it at all. It requires caution. You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has no reason to update. For example, if some `<div>` is always empty in the JSX, React won’t have a reason to touch its children list. Therefore, it is safe to manually add or remove elements there.

## Removing Effect Dependencies – React (2023-12-27)

In JavaScript, each newly created object and function is considered distinct from all the others. It doesn’t matter that the contents inside of them may be the same!

## Synchronizing with Effects – React (2023-12-27)

Before React can apply the Effect from the third render, it needs to clean up the last Effect that did run. The second render’s Effect was skipped, so React needs to clean up the first render’s Effect.

Each Effect “captures” the text value from its corresponding render. It doesn’t matter that the text state changed: an Effect from the render with text = 'ab' will always see 'ab'. In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you’re curious how this works, you can read about [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

React always cleans up the previous render’s Effect before the next render’s Effect.

If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either [abort the fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) or ignore its result:

```
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;

  async function startFetching() {
    const json = await fetchTodos(userId);
    if (!ignore) {
      setTodos(json);
    }
  }

  startFetching();

  return () => {
    ignore = true;
  };
}, [userId]);
```

You can’t “undo” a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that’s not relevant anymore does not keep affecting your application. If the userId changes from 'Alice' to 'Bob', cleanup ensures that the 'Alice' response is ignored even if it arrives after 'Bob'.

In development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab. There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the ignore variable will be set to true. So even though there is an extra request, it won’t affect the state thanks to the if (!ignore) check.

In production, there will only be one request. If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components:

If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values

There’s an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal—don’t try to make it go away!

React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed).

if ref was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array. However, this is good because you can’t know whether the parent component always passes the same ref, or passes one of several refs conditionally

This is because the ref object has a stable identity: React guarantees [you’ll always get the same object](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef#returns) from the same useRef call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too

React compares the dependency values using the [](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)[Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison.

Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside useEffect. In other words, useEffect “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.

Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.

Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components:

- Rendering code (introduced in [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. [Rendering code must be pure.](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure) Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else.
- Event handlers (introduced in [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain [“side effects”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).

## You Might Not Need an Effect – React (2023-12-27)

Although it’s common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)[useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)

Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect

When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is what kind of logic it is from the user’s perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it’s caused by the user seeing the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.

adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can [reset all state with a key](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes) or [calculate everything during rendering](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#updating-state-based-on-props-or-state) instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected item, you can store the selected item ID

When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the same component’s state during a render.

When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don’t put it in state.](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering. This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra “cascading” updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other).

Keep in mind that modern [frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production-grade-react-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.

There are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects:

- You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering.

## Lifecycle of Reactive Effects – React (2023-12-27)

All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component’s body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect’s dependencies.

In other words, Effects “react” to all values from the component body.

Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are reactive because they’re calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.

Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed.

The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to stop synchronizing:

```
const connection = createConnection(serverUrl,roomId);
connection.connect();
return()=>{
  connection.disconnect();
};
```

Intuitively, you might think that React would start synchronizing when your component mounts and stop synchronizing when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to start and stop synchronizing multiple times while the component remains mounted.

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it.

## Separating Events from Effects – React (2023-12-27)

Effect Events are non-reactive “pieces” of your Effect code. They should be next to the Effect using them.

Effect Events are very limited in how you can use them:
- Only call them from inside Effects.    
- Never pass them to other components or Hooks.

You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers. The main difference is that event handlers run in response to a user interactions, whereas Effect Events are triggered by you from Effects. Effect Events let you “break the chain” between the reactivity of Effects and code that should not be reactive.

Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies.

## Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks – React (2023-12-27)

Effects are an [“escape hatch”](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches): you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team’s goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.

## Using TypeScript – React (2023-12-27)

When determining the type you are looking for you can first look at the hover information for the event handler you are using, which will show the type of the event.

If you need to use an event that is not included in this list, you can use the React.SyntheticEvent type, which is the base type for all events.
